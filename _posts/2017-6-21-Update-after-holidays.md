I have taken some time off from coding/work to wonder around Podlasie. I've seen some pretty orthodox churches and eaten delicious Tatar cuisine, but now I'm back to, among other things, coding. I'have pushed some solutions to [Codility lessons](https://github.com/Aritzaranburu/Codility_lessons) today + read an article/guide to [Big-O Notation](http://blog.honeybadger.io/a-rubyist-s-guide-to-big-o-notation/)
