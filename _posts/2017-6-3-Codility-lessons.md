title: Codility lessons

It has been recently suggested to me that I start training on [Codility](codility.com), to improve my skills. It looked like a nice addition to *The Well-Grounded Rubyist*,
so I've decided to give it a try.
My first impression of the lessons is positive and I plan to complete all of them in the next few weeks. It should be a good change of pace from my Rails app.
