I am a junior Ruby / Ruby on Rails developer. I have acquired my previous work experience as an analyst and consultant in the investment industry. Working there taught me the importance of attention to detail and constant self-development, as well as the ability to break down complicated problems into actionable components. I am looking for opportunities to grow in an innovative environment. When I m not coding, I like to learn about game theory or eat something delicious
